# StudyFlex

StudyFlex is a simple student planner prototype built with React 18, Vite and Tailwind CSS. The app includes a mock authentication flow and the core pages from the mockups: Login, Sign up, Dashboard with weekly overview, multiâ€‘step Input Wizard, Settings and Task Details. The dashboard's weekly overview shows only study sessions generated by the scheduler; if no schedule exists the section stays hidden. State is stored in `localStorage` for demo purposes.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The development server will start with Vite on port 5173.

## Testing

```bash
npm test
```

(Tests are placeholders and simply print a message.)
